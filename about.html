            <p class="about-text">
                I am a postgraduate physics student with a growing passion for high-energy and particle
                physics, nuclear astrophysics, and cosmology. My curiosity orbits around the nature of matter
                under extreme conditions — from quark–gluon plasma to the dense cores of neutron stars.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I am fascinated by the elegant language of Quantum Field Theory, the dynamics of the early
                universe, nucleosynthesis pathways, gravitational waves, and the invisible architectures formed
                by dark matter and dark energy. My academic journey is driven by a desire to contribute to 
                fundamental research and to understand how the universe writes its own story.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Beyond equations and computations, I love exploring storytelling and science communication —
                translating complex physics into narratives that spark curiosity.
            </p>
