        <h1>ādi: The Genesis</h1>

        <p>
            Aditya is a science enthusiast who aspires to live on this planet with honesty. His birth was scheduled on the second day of the September month in the year 1999 at the historic and cultural city called Mysuru.

        <p>
            I am particularly interested in Quantum Chromodynamics, Quark–Gluon Plasma, Quantum Field 
            Theory, nucleosynthesis, neutron stars, gravitational waves, space weather, and the nature 
            of dark matter and dark energy. My motivation comes from connecting theory with observation, 
            and understanding how the smallest particles shape the largest structures in the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I continue to evolve as a researcher, I aim to contribute to scientific inquiry through 
            rigorous study, thoughtful experimentation, and a passion for uncovering the unknown.
