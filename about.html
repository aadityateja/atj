        <p>
            I am Aditya S, a postgraduate physics student driven by curiosity and a deep fascination 
            for the universe. My academic journey gravitates toward high-energy and particle physics, 
            nuclear astrophysics, and cosmology — fields that explore matter at its most fundamental 
            scales and the cosmos at its grandest.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am particularly interested in Quantum Chromodynamics, Quark–Gluon Plasma, Quantum Field 
            Theory, nucleosynthesis, neutron stars, gravitational waves, space weather, and the nature 
            of dark matter and dark energy. My motivation comes from connecting theory with observation, 
            and understanding how the smallest particles shape the largest structures in the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I continue to evolve as a researcher, I aim to contribute to scientific inquiry through 
            rigorous study, thoughtful experimentation, and a passion for uncovering the unknown.
